<h1>A little bit about different theory subjects we have learned about in class</h1>
    <h3>Server Side Rendering</h3>
    <p>Server Side Rendering is used in order for a user to not get sent a html file, it is already
        made in the backend.
        One way to do this is by concatinating in a JavaScript file. See codesnippets for an example.
    </p>

    <h3>Import/Export with Node Modules</h3>
    <p>
        You can use node modules to import and export, can be used to create routers as an example. 
    </p>

    <h3>REST API CRUD</h3>
    <p>
        CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete.
    </p>

    <p>
        REST API Conventions
        Order of methods - Get, Post, Put, Patch, Delete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Endpoint should match a specific standard, so you understand what it does just by looking at it
        collection, table should always be plural in the database and REST API.
    </p>

    <h3>Why don't we like for loops in Javascript</h3>
    <p>
        Overly verbose, Error Prone, Not functional.
    </p>

    <h3>Code conventions / Clean code</h3>
    <p>
        Make sure code is similar in the whole project. For example if you have a space before your curly brackets
        in a function make sure it is the same way in all your functions.
        Spaces in the project should also be similar.
    </p>
