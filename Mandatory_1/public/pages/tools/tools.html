<h1>This is a list of tools we have used in our course and short description of what they do</h1>
<h3>Node</h3>
    <p>Node is a JavaScript runtime environment. It is open-source, cross-platform and used for back-end. It runs on the V8 engine.
        With Node it is possible to create web servers by using JavaScript and the "node modules". These modules are used to handle core-functions.
    </p>

<h3>Nodemon</h3>
<p>
    Nodemon is a tool to run a node application that helps developers,
    as it restarts your node application whenever a file is changed in the directory.
    I believe you could also call it "Hot reload". 
    You can change it to do hot reload whenever specific types of files are changed in a "nodemon.json" file.
    As an example your node application is not reloaded when you change html or css,
    however if you specific what file types you wanna use for hotreloading it works with html and css.
    This code is used to specify js, json, html and css files to be detected with change for hot reload.
<pre>
<code>
    put this inside a nodemon.json file
    {
        "ext": "js, json, html, css"
    }
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Visual Studio</h3>
<p>
    Visual Studio is our IDE of choice for this course. We use it in order to get familiar with other IDE's,
    as we used IntelliJ the previous semesters. Visual Studio seems to take more use of the terminal, 
    which helps us get familiar with the terminal.
</p>

<h3>GitHub</h3>
<p>
    GitHub is a tool we use for version control. It is a way to share code. See terminal commands for how to use it in terminal.
</p>

<h3>Postman</h3>
<p>
    Postman is a tool used when creating API's. We use it to test our endpoints and test our REST api.
