<div class="div">
<h1>Use the navigation bar at the top to go to notes about specific topics</h1>
<p>
    I have written notes about a few topics that I believe will be useful for myself later on.
    <br>
    The idea is to have a place where I can quickly look up useful notes that I might need in the future.
